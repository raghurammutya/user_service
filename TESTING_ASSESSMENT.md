# User Service Testing Assessment

## üö¶ Current Testing Status

### ‚úÖ What's Been Tested (Basic Framework)
1. **Test Framework Structure**
   - Created test_runner.py for orchestrated testing
   - Basic health endpoint testing
   - Service startup/shutdown automation
   - Load testing framework

2. **Test Categories Created**
   - Health checks (`/health`, `/health/detailed`, `/health/integrations`)
   - Trading limits API endpoints (basic structure)
   - Authentication endpoints (basic structure)
   - Load testing (performance benchmarks)

### ‚ùå What Remains UNTESTED

#### üîê Authentication & Keycloak Integration
**Status: NOT TESTED WITH REAL DATA**
- [ ] Keycloak server connection and authentication
- [ ] JWT token validation and parsing
- [ ] User provisioning from Keycloak to local database
- [ ] Role-based access control (ADMIN, TRADER, VIEWER)
- [ ] Token refresh and expiration handling
- [ ] Authentication failures and edge cases

**Issues Identified:**
- Keycloak integration assumes `http://keycloak:8080` but service may not be running
- No test data for valid Keycloak users
- Authentication endpoints return 401 (expected) but not tested with real tokens

#### üí∞ Trading Limits - Core Business Logic
**Status: PARTIALLY TESTED (Structure Only)**
- [ ] **Positive Test Cases:**
  - [ ] Creating valid limits with sample trading accounts
  - [ ] Validating trades within limits (should PASS)
  - [ ] Different limit types (daily, single trade, order count, etc.)
  - [ ] Bulk limit creation for multiple users
  - [ ] Updating existing limits
  
- [ ] **Negative Test Cases:**
  - [ ] Trades exceeding daily limits (should REJECT)
  - [ ] Trades with restricted instruments (should BLOCK)
  - [ ] Trading outside allowed hours (should PREVENT)
  - [ ] Invalid limit configurations (should ERROR)
  - [ ] Unauthorized limit modifications (should DENY)

**Sample Test Data Needed:**
```json
{
  "trading_accounts": [
    {"id": 1, "user_id": 1, "broker": "ICICI", "account_number": "12345"},
    {"id": 2, "user_id": 2, "broker": "ZERODHA", "account_number": "67890"}
  ],
  "users": [
    {"id": 1, "email": "trader1@test.com", "role": "TRADER"},
    {"id": 2, "email": "trader2@test.com", "role": "VIEWER"}
  ],
  "limits": [
    {"type": "daily_trading_limit", "value": 50000.0, "account_id": 1},

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. Database Connection Fix (URGENT)
```bash
# Need to resolve TimescaleDB connection
# Options:
# A) Start Docker containers: docker-compose up timescaledb
# B) Use local PostgreSQL with test database
# C) Mock database for initial testing
```

### 2. Create Test Data Fixtures
```python
# Create fixtures with realistic trading data
SAMPLE_USERS = [
    {"email": "conservative.trader@test.com", "role": "TRADER"},
    {"email": "day.trader@test.com", "role": "TRADER"},
    {"email": "view.only@test.com", "role": "VIEWER"}
]

SAMPLE_TRADING_ACCOUNTS = [
    {"user_id": 1, "broker": "ICICI", "balance": 100000},
    {"user_id": 2, "broker": "ZERODHA", "balance": 500000}
]

SAMPLE_LIMITS = [
    {"account_id": 1, "type": "daily_limit", "value": 25000},
    {"account_id": 2, "type": "daily_limit", "value": 100000}
]
```

### 3. Keycloak Integration Test
```bash
# Set up test Keycloak instance OR
# Mock Keycloak responses for testing
# Test with real JWT tokens
```

### 4. End-to-End Business Logic Test
```python
# Test complete workflow:
# 1. User authenticates with Keycloak
# 2. User creates trading limits
# 3. Trade service validates against limits
# 4. Limits are enforced correctly
# 5. Breach notifications work
```

## üîß RECOMMENDED TESTING APPROACH

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (1-2 hours)
1. Fix database connection (Docker or local PostgreSQL)
2. Set up test data fixtures
3. Verify basic CRUD operations work

### Phase 2: Authentication (2-3 hours)  
1. Set up test Keycloak OR mock authentication
2. Test JWT token validation
3. Test role-based access control

### Phase 3: Core Business Logic (3-4 hours)
1. Test trading limits creation with real data
2. Test limit validation with sample trades
3. Test positive and negative scenarios
4. Test bulk operations

### Phase 4: Integration (2-3 hours)
1. Test service-to-service communication
2. Test external dependencies
3. Test error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 5: Performance (1-2 hours)
1. Load test with realistic data
2. Measure response times and resource usage
3. Identify bottlenecks

## üìã SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Minimum Viable Testing
- [ ] Service starts without errors
- [ ] Database operations work with test data
- [ ] Authentication returns proper responses
- [ ] Trading limits can be created and validated
- [ ] Health checks return accurate status

### Production Ready Testing

3. **Keycloak**: Authentication server not set up for testing
4. **Integration**: External services not available in test environment

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Fix database connection and create test data
2. **Short-term**: Implement positive/negative test cases with real data
3. **Medium-term**: Set up Keycloak integration testing
4. **Long-term**: Comprehensive performance and security testing
